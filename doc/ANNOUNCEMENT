                         tinyproxy 1.1 is now out!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  tinyproxy is a small HTTP proxy, ideal for use in small network
situations where a (much) larger, caching proxy like squid might
very well be overkill, or a security hazard.  New in this version:

  - General source cleanup.
  - Load average monitoring (you can configure tinyproxy to stop
    handling connections after the load average reaches a certain
    point).
  - Remote monitoring of proxy status (you can get the server 
    stats previously only accessable via SIGUSR1 through the
    WWW instead).
  - The ability to change users after binding to a port and 
    opening the log files - thus it can run as non-root even
    when listening on a low port.
