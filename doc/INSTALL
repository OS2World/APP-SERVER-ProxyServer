  INSTALLING
  ----------
 
  Here are some nice step-by-step instructions on how to get tinyproxy up
and running.

  - Get the latest version from http://tinyproxy.attacca.com/

  - Edit the Makefiles in src/ and doc/ off the main tinyproxy directory.
    The things to pay attention to are the paths that compiled output
    and manpages are going to be installed to.  They're preconfigured
    for Linux.  In addition, please also look in src/tinyproxy.h - 
    there are many parameters to be changed within.  Anyone up for
    autoconfing this whole thing?

  - Run "make install" from the root tinyproxy directory.

  - Type "man tinyproxy" to figure out what commandline arguments 
    you want to specify.  Most people will simply modify tinyproxy.h
    (see step 1) to meet their needs, so it's doubtful any commandline
    arguments will be required, unless you're using ANON mode filtering. 
    But the manpage is good to read anyway.

  - If you want tinyproxy to run every time you start your system,
    put it in rc.local (or your system's equivalent).  It can
    just be run like so:

    /usr/local/bin/tinyproxy

    (or whatever path you installed tinyproxy to)

  - Once you have things up and running, you have the option of going
    into the 'doc' subdirectory off the main tinyproxy directory and
    running:

    ./report.sh

   This will mail a short report about your system (more or less just the
   OS version and how much memory tinyproxy is taking up) to
   sdyoung@well.com so I can gather a list of what operating systems it's 
   been tried under, etc.
