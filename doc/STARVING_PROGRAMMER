  THE STARVING PROGRAMMER
  -----------------------

  Ok.  So I'm not quite 'starving', but I am looking for a part time
coding/sysadmin job.  Are you in the middle of scouring the land for
someone that can program C, has experience administrating heavy-duty
production machines, and is willing to work late into the wee hours of
the morning until his eyes are glazed from staring at the monitor for so
long without blinking? Hey, have a look at my resume:
