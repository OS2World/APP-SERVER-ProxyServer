  The following are some features that I'd like to add to tinyproxy in the
future.  Where possible, I've listed the person who suggested it.  This
list is in no particular order.  And hey, if you want to implement one of
these, or another idea you have, go right ahead.  Just mail me the diff
against the 1.1 tree and I'll integrate it if possible. 

  - Change the way sockets are handled so everything is nonblocking. 
    This will speed things up a bit and ensure smooth operation
    on slow links. 
    Suggested: Thomas Roessle.
  - Include hooks so other types of proxies can be modularly added to  
    the source tree.  Then people can simply choose which types of 
    proxies (ftp, www, etc) they'd like enabled in tinyproxy.h 
    Suggested: Tarun Tuli.
  - Make the source tree autoconf-ed so people can avoid editing
    tinyproxy.h and the like.
  - Add some kind of access control mechanism - probably IP-based, 
    so users can choose only to let people from certain networks/ips
    use the proxy.  This becomes more of an issue with FTP proxies
    and the like.
  - Find a more elegant solution to embedding HTML documents in the 
    source than the current method.  (see httperr() and showstats() for 
    examples of how it's done right now).
